**CRUD Burger POS System lite**

---

This app is a simple program to help a server communicate with the cooking staff.  When an order is placed, input into the form by a server, it is created in a table named "burgers".  The contents of that table are then visually represented in the "Orders Placed" div to the left with two corresponding buttons: "MADE!" and "DELETE".  If the "MADE!" button is hit by the cooking staff, it moves from the "Orders Placed" div to the "Orders Up" div.  When it moves into "Orders Up", the "MADE!" button becomes a "NOT MADE?" button.  This is in case it the burger is not made yet and the staff misclicked.

This app uses the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* node.js
  * express
  * express-handlebars
  * mysql
* MySQL Database
* MVC Architecture
